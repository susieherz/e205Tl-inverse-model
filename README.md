e205Tl Inverse Model:

This code runs the Tl isotope inverse model used in Herz et al., 2026 (link to paper)

The U isotope inverse model which this model is based on is from Kipp and Tissot, 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2021.117240). The original code can be found here: https://github.com/m-kipp/d238U-inverse-model.git

If you use the Tl isotope inverse model, we ask that you please cite Herz et al., 2026 and send a copy of papers published to the lead authors (herz@stanford.edu and limh@ustc.edu.cn).

This code can be run in R using one of two versions of the data available in this repository. The first is "Herz_et_al_2026.csv," which includes data from all four sections presented in Herz et al., 2026 and the three from Newby et al., 2021, and "Herz_et_al_2026_best_sections.csv" which only includes data from the four of these sections which include Tl isotope data extending before and after the end-Permian mass extinction.
