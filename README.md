e205Tl Inverse Model:

This code runs the Tl isotope inverse model used in Herz et al., 2026 (link to paper)

The U isotope inverse model which this model is based on is from Kipp and Tissot, 2022 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2021.117240). The original code can be found here: https://github.com/m-kipp/d238U-inverse-model.git

If you use the Tl isotope inverse model, we ask that you please cite Herz et al., 2026 and send a copy of papers published to the lead authors (herz@stanford.edu and limh@ustc.edu.cn).
